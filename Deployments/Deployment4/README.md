The goal of Deployment 4:

 * create a CI/CD pipeline from start to finish.
 * leveraging AWS, deploy a customized VPC into the cloud infrastructure & pipeline
 * Configure a Jenkins master & a Jenkins agent in different VPCs
 * execute builds/tests in the pipeline
 * add additional validation test
 * trigger & automate the deployment of a Flask application to open source software (Nginx & Gunicorn) in a different VPC
